🌸 LexiBloom – Blooming Accessibility with AI

LexiBloom is an AI and machine learning–powered accessibility platform designed to empower individuals with Dyslexia, ADHD, and Low Vision by making digital reading and interaction more inclusive. The platform leverages NLP, adaptive learning, and computer vision techniques to personalize accessibility support. Its mission is to ensure that accessibility is not a privilege but a right, enabling everyone to learn, create, and communicate without barriers.

🚀 Features
✨ Multi-Mode Accessibility

Dyslexia Mode → NLP-based text restructuring, dyslexia-friendly fonts, structured reading, and optimized color contrast.

ADHD Mode → ML-assisted distraction reduction, focus-oriented content presentation, and reading assistance.

Low Vision Mode → Adaptive typography scaling, ML-guided high-contrast layouts, and screen-reader integration.

🧠 AI-Driven Personalization

Machine learning models adapt UI elements based on user interaction patterns and preferences.

NLP-driven smart text restructuring to improve readability while preserving semantic meaning.

👀 Eye-Controlled Keyboard

Computer vision–based gaze tracking using OpenCV enables hands-free typing.

ML-assisted eye-movement detection supports users with limited motor control.

🌐 Cross-Platform

Optimized for web and mobile platforms with consistent ML-driven accessibility behavior.

🏗️ Implementation Plan

LexiBloom is being developed in three structured phases:

Prototype Phase → Core accessibility modes using NLP-based text processing.

Integration Phase → Machine learning personalization engine and computer vision–based eye-controlled virtual keyboard.

Deployment Phase → Model refinement through user testing, performance optimization, and scalable release.

📂 Tech Stack
